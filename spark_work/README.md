# Learning Spark and Scala!

Hello, this is where I place the work I do while following the udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data

This is mostly here for archival purposes.


# Setup
- Setup complete. Installed via homebrew install apache-spark. After that, set up the log4j file, and ran a test read onto a file. This was quick and easy. I chose not to download an IDE because I personally find not working with an IDE more frictionless. It's one less tool I will have to learn to really dive into the material.

# Movie Lense Dataset
This was quick. In the second lecture I already got to begin working on the 
movielense dataset.

Refer to the MovieLense folder for project material.

- Movie Lense Dataset: Will not be contained due to size. please put data into data folder if you would like to follow along.
- Ouch, just realized that scala is based off java and it may be painful to not program in an IDE. Humm, I wonder how far I would be able to go without it.
- Humm that was short lived. I already installed the IDE because a lot of the importations done for this course are done quick rapidly via the IDE. The course seems like it would be difficult to follow without using the same IDE.
- Got my first java package running in the scala IDE. I found it odd that we imported all the spark external jars for this course. I seems like too much.
- So far everything has been pretty easy to do, and I'm excited to learn some scala.
