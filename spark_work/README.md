# Learning Spark and Scala!

Hello, this is where I place the work I do while following the udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data

This is mostly here for archival purposes.


# Setup
- Setup complete. Installed via homebrew install apache-spark. After that, set up the log4j file, and ran a test read onto a file. This was quick and easy. I chose not to download an IDE because I personally find not working with an IDE more frictionless. It's one less tool I will have to learn to really dive into the material.
